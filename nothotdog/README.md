As a fan of Silicon Valley I found a project where someone on hugging face uploaded a ML model that identifies whether a hot dog is in indeed an hot dog when uploading images. 
This was inspired from the fictional character Jin Yang who was looking for funding for his "startup" idea utilizing computer vision to identify if something is a hot dog or not rather than identifying all sorts of foods.

- I created a web form using Flask
- When uploading an image to the web form it will send that data to the hugging face model via API
- This will return prediction scores for "hot dog" and "not a hot dog"
Skills used: Flask, Python3 and libraries, API connections, Hugging Face
